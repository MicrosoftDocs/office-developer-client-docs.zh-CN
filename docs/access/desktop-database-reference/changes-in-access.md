- <span data-ttu-id="a8a41-125">**转换为 Access 应用**：借助 Access，可以将表导入新的 Access 应用，这将自动为你创建应用程序的窗体。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="a8a41-125">**Convert to an Access app** - Using Access, you can import your tables into a new Access app and forms for your application are automatically created for you.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="a8a41-126">可以扩展 Access 为你创建的基本窗体的功能，用户可以在 Web 上使用你的应用程序。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="a8a41-126">You can extend the functionality of the base forms Access creates for you and users can use your application on the web.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="a8a41-127">Although some of the functionality that you use in ADPs may not be available now, expect Microsoft to continue to focus improvements in the product for this application type.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="a8a41-127">Although some of the functionality that you use in ADPs may not be available now, expect Microsoft to continue to focus improvements in the product for this application type.</span></span>

- <span data-ttu-id="a8a41-131">**创建混合应用程序**：如果你的应用程序较大，并且你不需要在同一时间转换全部内容，可以将数据导入 Access 应用并以 .accdb 文件形式链接到 SQL Server 数据库。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="a8a41-131">**Create a hybrid application** - If your application is large and you don't want to convert everything at the same time, you can import your data into an Access app and link to the SQL Server database from an .accdb.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="a8a41-132">这样就可以逐步迁移、逐步向 Access 应用添加窗体和功能，在 Access 应用后台使用链接表将 .accdb 文件形式的客户端应用程序保存到 SQL Server 数据库。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="a8a41-132">This allows you migrate gradually, adding forms and functionality over time to your Access app while maintaining your client application as an .accdb with linked tables to the SQL Server database behind the Access app.</span></span>

- <span data-ttu-id="a8a41-133">**升级到 .NET Framework**：根据应用程序的复杂程度，可能需要考虑移至 .NET Framework 等专业开发平台。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="a8a41-133">**Upgrade to the .NET Framework** - Your application may be complex enough that to consider moving to a professional development platform such as the .NET Framework.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="a8a41-134">借助 SQL Server，可以更轻松地使用现有数据库基础结构和扩展应用程序功能，而无需大规模地重写代码。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="a8a41-134">SQL Server is designed to make it easier for you to use your existing database infrastructure you've already created and extend the functionality of your application without having to significantly rewrite your code.</span></span>
